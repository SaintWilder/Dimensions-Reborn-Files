# Bakugan Dimensions Game Architecture

## Overview
Bakugan Dimensions is a web-based game that recreates the original Bakugan Dimensions online game, focusing on content from Seasons 1 and 2 of the Bakugan series. The game allows players to collect Bakugan, battle other players, and customize their avatars.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with Canvas for battle animations)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user data, Bakugan data, and game state)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication

## Core Components

### 1. User System

- User profile with statistics
- Friends list and messaging

### 2. Bakugan Collection System
- Bakugan inventory management
- Bakugan attributes (Pyrus, Aquos, Subterra, Haos, Darkus, Ventus)
- Bakugan stats and levels
- Bakugan evolution

### 3. Battle System

### 4. Card System

## Data Flow
1. User logs in and loads their profile data
2. User navigates the world map and interacts with NPCs or other players
3. When entering a battle:
   - Battle data is initialized
   - Players select their Bakugan and cards
   - Turn-based battle commences
   - Battle results are calculated and stored
4. User's progress is updated after battles or completing objectives

## Technical Considerations
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Optimized battle animations for performance
- Secure user authentication and data storage
- Scalable database design for future content additions
